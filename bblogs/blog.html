                <h2>First Week of Class!</h2>
                <p>Well, one week in and I made it! CSS is a little confusing at times, but I learned great jokes!
                I.E. There was a back end developer and he moved into a new apartment. But all of his stuff was just piled up on his bed in the middle of his room. His new room mate came by and asked, “why haven’t you decorated yet?” And he said, “Because these apartments make you decorate by CSS”

                Love it with Austin Coding Academy and looking forward to the rest!...</p>

                <p>Well, first week of projects completed and I haven’t run away screaming! Just kidding. But honestly the whole experience so far has been a blast Austin Coding Academy. So here we go!
                What has your experience learning to code been like so far? What would you change about it?...</p>
